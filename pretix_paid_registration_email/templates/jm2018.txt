Here's your confirmation for the event!
For the 5th Atlanta Technology Jingle Mingle, we've again joined forces with all the local tech meetups and with the awesome Atlanta Startup, Web, Entrepreneur, and Tech (SWEeT) Party for an evening of networking, sharing stories, and having a few drinks while toasting to a great 2018. Tickets are $20 and include adult beverages and food. The rumor on the street is that Santa will be making an appearance and raffling off some prizes too!

Please be responsible and, if you have a little to much holiday cheer, please take public transport, a cab, Lyft or Uber to get home
